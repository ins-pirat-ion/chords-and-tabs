   Childhood living    is easy to do

Ami               C       D  G                   D
   The things you wanted,      I bought them for you, 

Hmi          G     Hmi                G
   Graceless lady      you know who I am,

Ami                 C       D  G                   D
   You know I can't let you       slide through my hands

R: Wild  Horses,   couldn't drag me,  away,

Ami    G C     D G       F              C
   Wild  Horses,   we'll ride them some day
   

Hmi              G      Hmi               G
   I watched you suffer     a dull aching pain,

Ami             C     D  G                D
   Now you've decided      to show me the same

Hmi            G     Hmi            G
   No sweeping exits    or offstage lines

Ami                 C       D  G                D
   Can make me feel bitter       or treat you unkind

   I know I dreamed you      a sin and a lie,

Ami          C       D  G                        D
   I have my freedom       but I don't have much time

Hmi               G       Hmi                 G
   Faith has been broken,       tears must be cried,

Ami              C       D  G           D
   Let's do some living        after we die
