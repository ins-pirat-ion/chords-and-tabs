I:
     [:10x    F#  G    :]
F#                            G
One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small
        F#                               G
and the ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all
       A5    C             D        A
go ask Alice    when she's ten feet tall

       F#
And if you go chasing rabbits and
    G
you know you're going to fall
          F#                            G
Tell'em a hooka-smoking caterpillar has given you the call
     A      C       D            A
Call Alice     when she was just small

E                                     A
When men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go
        E
and you just had some kind of mushroom
         A
and your mind is moving slow
       F#            
go ask Alice, I think she'll know

F#                             G
When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead
        F#                                 
and the white knight is talking backwards 
        G
and the red queen's off with her head
  A      C          D        A
Remember   what the Dormouse said
E         A     E         A
Feed your head! Feed your head!
