C             Am           G      D 
   Wondering aloud, how we feel today

C                        Am         G            D     C    D
   Last night sipped the sunset, my hands on her hair

C                 D              G      G/F#     D 
   We are our own Saviours as we start, both our hearts

           Em      G            D 
   Beating life,      into each other.

C            Am              G              D 
   Wondering aloud, will the years treat us well?

C                       Am          G           D    G   C D
   As she floats in the kitchen I'm tasting the smell

C                  D 
   Of Toast as the butter runs

            G      G/F#     D             Em
   Then she comes, spilling crumbs on the bed

G                 D
   And I shake my head

            Dm       C              G             Em
   And it's only the giving that makes you

            D
   What you are
