<span class="objectLine">Orig: E - Kapo: 2</span>

<span class="chordLine">  D</span>
Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
<span class="chordLine">        Emi</span>
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
<span class="chordLine">        D</span>
And you know that she's half-crazy but that's why you want to be there
<span class="chordLine">        F#mi                                G</span>
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
<span class="chordLine">         D                                  Emi</span>
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
<span class="chordLine">        D</span>
Then he gets you on her wavelength
<span class="chordLine">                  Emi                               D                      D</span>
          And she lets the river answer that you've always been her lover
<span class="objectLine">R:</span>
<span class="chordLine">        F#mi                             G</span>
And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind    And you
<span class="chordLine">D                                Emi                                D</span>
know that she will trust you For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

<span class="chordLine">    D</span>
And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
<span class="chordLine">       Emi</span>
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
<span class="chordLine">    D</span>
And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
<span class="chordLine">        F#mi                           G</span>
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
<span class="chordLine">    D                             Emi</span>
But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open
<span class="chordLine">              D                       Emi                             D     D</span>
          Foresaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
<span class="objectLine">R:</span>
<span class="chordLine">        F#mi                         G</span>
And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind       And you
<span class="chordLine">D                                         Emi                                D  D</span>
think you maybe you'll trust him For he's touched your perfect body with her mind

<span class="chordLine">       D</span>
Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
<span class="chordLine">      Emi</span>
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters
<span class="chordLine">        D</span>
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
<span class="chordLine">        F#mi                              G</span>
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
<span class="chordLine">          D                                Emi</span>
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
<span class="chordLine">         D                                  Emi</span>
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever
<span class="chordLine">                  D</span>
          While Suzanne holds her mirror
<span class="objectLine">R:</span>
<span class="chordLine">        F#mi                             G</span>
And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind          And you
<span class="chordLine">D                                     Emi                                D  D</span>
know that you can trust her For she's touched your perfect body with her mind
