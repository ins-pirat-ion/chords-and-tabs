1. I don't know you but I want you all the more for that
   C                     F                C                F
   Words fall through me n'always fool me and I can't react
   Ami        G      Fmaj     G                 Ami
   Games that never amount to more than they're meant

   C                  Fmaj  F6          Ami7                  G  F

   C                  F            C                    F
   Moods that take me and erase me and I'm painted black
