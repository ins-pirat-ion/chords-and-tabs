Tall'n'tan and young'n'lovely the girl from Ipanema goes walking
    Dmi7                  Ddim    G7           Cmaj
And when she passes, each one she passes goes     "Ahhh."

Cmaj
When she walks, she's like a samba
     D7
That swing's so cool and sway's so gentle,
          Dmi7                  Ddim    G7           Cmaj
     That when she passes, each one she passes goes   "Ahhh."

   Oh but I watch her so sadly   How   can I tell her I love her
   D9           Dmi7          B9
   Yes, I would give my heart gladly,
            Emi7                      A75-
   But each day when she walks to the sea,
          Dmi7                         C#9
      She looks straight ahead, not at me.

And when she passes,  I smile, But she doesn't see,
   C#9         Cmaj    C#9         Cmaj
no she doesn't see, No she doesn't see.
