# chords-and-tabs
Chords and tabs of songs I like and haven't found anywhere else in quality sufficient for my campfire playing

* Songs are supposed to work in plaintext with fixed-width fonts
* written following rules described in
  https://github.com/ins-pirat-ion/sandpile#chordsvim
  so they can be highlighted in vim ( http://www.vim.org/ ) by chords.vim
  and transposed by https://github.com/ins-pirat-ion/sandpile#chords_transposerb
* find coloured / highlighed html versions of songs in https://github.com/ins-pirat-ion/chords-and-tabs/tree/master/vimhighlighted
